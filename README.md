# 🧬 Chirality Origins

> Modeling, analyzing, and simulating hypotheses for the origin of biomolecular chirality on early Earth and beyond.

## 🌍 Overview

This repository explores a range of **biophysical and chemical models** for how **biological homochirality** may have emerged — one of the most fundamental questions in astrobiology, origin-of-life research, and molecular biology.

The project draws from **interdisciplinary ideas** spanning:

- Astrobiology (e.g., meteorite enantiomeric excess)
- Vesicle-based protection and selection
- Salt-induced peptide formation (SIPF)
- UV circularly polarized light (CPL)
- Membrane-peptide interactions
- Autocatalysis and symmetry breaking

## 🔬 Research Goals

- Simulate the interaction of vesicles with UV light and racemic mixtures
- Model how membrane rafts influence selection of L- vs. D-peptides
- Explore mechanisms behind enantiomeric excess in meteorites vs. asteroid samples
- Reconstruct prebiotic pathways leading to chirality-based selection
